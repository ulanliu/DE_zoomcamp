## Question 1: Enter the Output Displayed After Running Terraform Apply
I set the project ID default value, so I don't need to enter the project ID

Output:
```
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
